        Version 0.6.1 BETA
        Fixed a bug with app windows having multiple toolbars, now there is only one extra when an app is opened/closed
        Made a sort of functional web browser that loads Bing as google doesn't work with embeds, this browser even has it's own startup sequence!
        Added a link to the old site in the welcome window, look at the link below the Discord tag
        Changed the date to January 11 2022
