       <b>CHANGELOG</b>
        
   </p>
   <br></br>
    <h4>April 18, 2022</h4>
    <br></br>
      <p>
      Version 1.2 ALPHA [Discontinued]
      </p>
<br></br>
<p>
      <b>This page has been discontinued due to time constraints and just overall laziness and will instead be used to play backups of my itch.io games. The website is still functional, however and gets the games from a folder in the website. This is just a heads up. It was nice to have this site.</b>
</p>
<br></br>
<p>
      
      - Replaced Friday Night Funkin' with a TG20 Games window to play all my games as itch.io backups
    
    <br></br>
      

      - Added all my itch.io games as backups to the site. List can be found either at https://resite.link/tg20games or https://tg20yt.github.io/tg20games/games.html

      <br></br>

      - Changed welcome screen to a warning indicating that this site is used for hosting of my itch.io backups now. (it's obvious if you went to the website without any subpages in the url, an example is adding /os.html to https://tg20yt.github.io)

      <br></br>

      - Fixed the double-window glitch again (sorta)

      <br></br>

      - Changed name to "Legacy Site"

    <br></br>
      
      - Added custom 404 page. Try it out by entering this url - https://tg20yt.github.io/404.html

    <br></br>
      
      - Played Geometry Dash on Oculus Quest 2. Not kidding, I actually did. Check out my chromebook tutorial on how to do it here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1FzL2sblR4

    <br><br>
      
      - And my gameplay here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr0UWAJwlQU
        
    </p>
<br></br>
<p> <h2>Next update plans</h2>
- None as this site <b>WILL NOT</b> recieve anymore updates other than more games being added. <b>So DON'T ask why this site isn't getting updates! Ff you want an updated version, follow this link</b>
