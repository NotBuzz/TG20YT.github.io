        January 12, 2022
        
        Version 0.6.2 BETA
        Hopefully this time the window bug is fixed completly
        The browser app is no longer resizable and now runs at 1280x720
        The desktop background has been changed (obvious if you are reading this on the site)
        
    </p>
    <p>
        Next update plans
        Making another HTML document to embed as a socials app
        Removing the meme button
        Probably make a music player or something
