CHANGELOG

January 11, 2022

Version 0.6 BETA

- Fixed a bug with app windows having multiple toolbars, now there is only one extra when an app is opened/closed
- Made a sort of functional web browser that loads Bing as google doesn't work with embeds, this browser even has it's own startup sequence!
- Added a link to the old site in the welcome window, look at the link below the Discord tag
- Changed the date to January 11 2022

Next update plans

- Changing the WylieGDPS tools to have the changelog instead
- Making another HTML document to embed as a socials app
- Changing the background to something else
- Removing the meme button
